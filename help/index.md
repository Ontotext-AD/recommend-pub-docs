# Contact the developers

We will be happy to help you via email:

* iliya.trendafilov at ontotext.com

It is also a common practice for us to organize Skype chats and/or custom mailing lists for each of our clients.

# Why do it in this way?

We know it would be good to have a place where our users share insight between themselves, but we haven't set up one yet.
One of the main reasons not to do it lies in the fact that we work with publishers and their data is sensitive, so they can't freely give examples. Instead, we try to
raise visibility by updating our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq/">FAQ</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/known-issues/">Known Issues</a> and also the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap/">Roadmap</a> to show what we're currently working on.
