==================

## About this documentation

This is the technical documentation of the Recommendation Engine API.
It contains information about how to get the engine up and running, how to ingest content into it, log user actions, tune the recommendation algorithm, scale, and deploy.

## How this documentation is organized

The documentation uses Jekyll as a site generator. And the documentation structure follows jekyll's conventions for organizing content. Basically, it consists of static and dynamic content. The static pages are the ones that are not updated regularly such as Home, Roadmap and Help. The dynamic content are pages written in Markdown format, which you can find in the _docs and _posts folders, and which can be changed/updated at any moment. Such pages are the ones from the HowTo's and Release sections.

Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means we use Jekyll to host our documentation website from GitHubâ€™s server directly.

## How to add content to the documentation

### Add a new page to the documentation

* Add a page in markdown in _docs
*  Add a config entry in _data/docs.yml

### Add release notes

* Copy release notes markdown from GitHub
* Add to _posts, while respecting the naming convention

### Test changes

* You need Jekyll installed
* Then go to your local clone of the documentation repo and execute {code}jekyll serve{code}
* The documentation is then available on http://localhost:4000
* When changing the *.yml file(s) a Jekyll restart is required
* For all other changes they're applied immediately

## Deploy changes

Just push to the master branch.

# Caveats

## Code blocks

When writing in markdown, need to wrap a multi-line code block in <pre/> in order to preserve white spaces. Single lines/embedded code snippets are fine the way they are.

## Front matter

* Category comes from the _data/docs.yaml
* Permalink is docs/file-name/
