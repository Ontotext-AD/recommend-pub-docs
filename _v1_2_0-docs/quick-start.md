# 0. What are the minimum system requirements?

JDK requirements:

* Java 7 or later installed.
* We use the Oracle's JDK 8 and haven't tested with OpenJDK.

Preferred OS:

* Ubuntu - all our test and production servers are on Ubuntu.
* Our developer machines run Ubuntu/RedHat/Mac OS X, so these should be ok too.

# 1. Get access to the system components

We don't offer evaluation licenses and trials at the moment. If you want to evaluate the engine, please contact sales@ontotext.com to get credentials for the Maven repository where the artifacts are stored.

# 2. Install

Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/v1_2_0-docs/installation">Installation</a> page.

# 3. Add content with tags

See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/v1_2_0-docs/uploading-articles">Uploading Articles</a> page.

# 4. Get content-based recommendations

Now you have content in the system and can get basic contextual recommendations. For details, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/v1_2_0-docs/content-based-recommendation">Content-based recommendation<a/> page.

# 5. Take a break

Now you have setup the recommendations components successfully, you deserve a break. Behavioral recommendations and tunning the algorithm weights are the next things you
 are probably most interested in. You can find how in the HowTo section.
