## About

This site aims to be the comprehensive guide to the Ontotext Recommendations engine. We'll cover topics such as getting the engine up and running, ingesting content into the system, logging user actions, tuning the recommendation algorithm, scaling, and deployment.

## Who is this site for

Basically, this is a technical documentation and is written to be used by technical people. Whether you're an architect, evaluating how this recommendations engine fits as a component to your system, or you're a developer who has already integrated it and actively consumes its features - this is the complete reference. We also try to provide as much as possible insight into what we're currently working on and our future ideas via the roadmap page and will keep you posted with news about releases and upgrade paths.
