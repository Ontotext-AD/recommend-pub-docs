# How do I get access to the system components?

We don't have licensing and trials atm, so please contact someone @ontotext to provide user/pass.

# What are the minimum system requirements?

- Java 7 installed, preferred production OS - Ubuntu (all our test and production servers are on Ubuntu). Our developer machines run Ubuntu/RedHat/Mac OS X, which is good to know.
# Installation - link it, if there are issues link Help page
# Usage - link HowTos
