# 0. What are the minimum system requirements?

JDK requirements:

* Java 7 or later installed
* We use the Oracle's JDK 8 and haven't tested with OpenJDK

Preferred OS:

* Ubuntu - all our test and production servers are on Ubuntu
* Our developer machines run Ubuntu/RedHat/Mac OS X, so these should be ok too

# 1. Get access to the system components

We don't have licensing and trials at the moment, so please contact sales@ontotext.com to get credentials for the Maven repository where the artifacts are stored.

# 2. Install

Check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/installation">Installation</a> page.

# 3. Add content with tags

See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/uploading-articles">Uploading Articles<a> page.

# 4. Get content based recommendations

Now you have content in the system and can get basic contextual recommendations. See how <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/content-based-recommendation">here<a/>.

# 5. Take a break

Now you have setup the recommendations components successfully and deserve a break. Behavioral recommendations and tunning the algorithm weights are the next things you
 are probably most interested in. You can find how in the HowTo section on your left.
