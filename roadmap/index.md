## Foreword

In an effort to be transparent with our roadmap, we publish in advance the important changes we are working on. We will try to stick to our release deadlines, but usually it is much easier to commit to month or quarter estimates for some of the more difficult ones. Since we are a small team and not all dependencies are in our control, release dates can change and we will give our best to communicate updates as soon as possible. This roadmap intends to show future changes that may affect existing applications and also includes new features we are working on.

## Upcoming changes

## Early 2015

### Relevance based on the behaviour of “People Like Me”

This is essentially a collaborative filtering based on user profile similarity. Relevance is calculated based on similarity between entities and terms the users read about.

### Relevance based on the behaviour of “People Near Me”

This feature identifies clusters of individuals geographically near a user’s area of interest, where “near” is defined as the neighbourhood, hometown, or country selected by the user.

### ”Why am I seeing this?”

This is something we have planned to implement for quite some time now, for two reasons:
- debugging and internal analysis;
- showing the user why they are recommended a piece of content.

This can potentially allow us to provide end users with means to fine-tune what is recommended to them (the different weights of the recommendation algorithm).
