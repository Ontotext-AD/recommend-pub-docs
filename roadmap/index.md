## Foreword

In an effort to be transparent with our roadmap, we publish in advance the important changes that are in progress. As we are a small team and not all dependencies are in our control, release dates may change but we will do our best to notify you about them as soon as possible. This roadmap shows planned future changes that may affect existing applications and includes the new features we are currently working on.

## Upcoming changes

### Early 2016

#### Relevance based on the behaviour of “People Like Me”

This is a collaborative filtering based on user profile similarity. Relevance is calculated based on similarity between entities and terms the users read about.

#### Relevance based on the behaviour of “People Near Me”

This feature identifies clusters of individuals geographically near the user’s area of interest, where “near” is defined as the neighbourhood, hometown, or country selected by the user.

#### ”Why am I seeing this?”

This is something we have been planning to implement for quite some time for two reasons:

- debugging and internal analysis;
- showing the user why they are recommended a piece of content.

This can potentially allow us to provide end users with means to fine-tune what is recommended to them (the different weights of the recommendation algorithm).
