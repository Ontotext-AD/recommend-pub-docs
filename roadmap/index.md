## Foreword

In an effort to be transparent with our roadmap, we are publishing in advance the important changes that are in progress. As we are a small team and not all dependencies are in our control, release dates may change in some circumstances but we will do our best to communicate them as soon as possible. This roadmap intends to show future changes that may affect existing applications and also includes the new features we are currently working on.

## Upcoming changes

### Early 2015

#### Relevance based on the behaviour of “People Like Me”

This is essentially a collaborative filtering based on user profile similarity. Relevance is calculated based on similarity between entities and terms the users read about.

#### Relevance based on the behaviour of “People Near Me”

This feature identifies clusters of individuals geographically near the user’s area of interest, where “near” is defined as the neighbourhood, hometown, or country selected by the user.

#### ”Why am I seeing this?”

This is something we have planned to implement for quite some time now, for two reasons:

- debugging and internal analysis;
- showing the user why they are recommended a piece of content.

This can potentially allow us to provide end users with means to fine-tune what is recommended to them (the different weights of the recommendation algorithm).
