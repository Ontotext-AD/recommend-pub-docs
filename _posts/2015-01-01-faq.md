## Is there a max number of articles one can POST to /content at a time?

As this method takes a single JSON in the request body, it is not streaming and the whole request has to be able to fit in memory. Only limitation is the available memory on the `recommendations-web` node. Practically speaking, chunks of up to 100mb will succeed most of the time. What is the number of articles for such chunks, of course, depends on the article size.
